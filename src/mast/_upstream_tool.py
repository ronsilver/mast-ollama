SEQUENTIAL_THINKING_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """\
A tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and \
evolve. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding \
deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the solution path isn't clear upfront
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need careful consideration of multiple aspects

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what you thought was the end
- thought_number: Current thought number
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: Branching point thought number
- branch_id: Branch identifier
- needs_more_thoughts: If you realize you need more thoughts

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed
4. Use is_revision when reconsidering previous thinking
5. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done\
